## Features

- List key features of your application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Docker: [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- Docker Compose: Should be included with Docker Desktop installations.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Sample-Fullstack-Application.git

Build and start the application using Docker Compose:

docker-compose up -d
This command will build the Docker images for each service and start the containers in detached mode (-d).

Verify that the containers are running:
docker-compose ps
Usage
Accessing the Application
Frontend: Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:80 to view the frontend.
Backend: The backend API is accessible at http://localhost:3000.
Database: Access the database using your preferred MySQL client. Use localhost as the host, root as the user, and mysecretpassword (or the values from your .env file) as the password.
Stopping the Application
To stop and remove the Docker containers without deleting the images:

docker-compose down
